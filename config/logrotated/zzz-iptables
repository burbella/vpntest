# Zzz Ubuntu Logrotate fragment for iptables logs
#
# max 360 files rotated once per minute, if they exceed 1MB in size
# combine this with the logs-per-minute limits in the iptables rules to try to keep logs around 1MB in size
# on a busy server with the max 1000 packets/minute being logged, logs appear to become about 1.3MB in 1 minute, for a total of about 500MB max disk usage
# NOTE:
#   The "rotate" command is a more graceful than "restart"
#   This fails: systemctl rotate rsyslog
#   Workaround: service rsyslog rotate
