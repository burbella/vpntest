Zzz Enhanced VPN Installation Instructions
==========================================

Latest Release Version: 24

NOTE: This system will require all the server's resources and will make various system config changes. Put it on a box that is not used for anything else.

Start a new Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server
    minimum requirements: 1 CPU, 2 GB RAM, 20GB HDD, 1 network interface
Give it an IPv4 (and optional IPv6) external address.
The server's IPv4 cannot be in this range:
    10.0.0.0/12 (those are used by the VPN)
Setup an EXTERNAL firewall with only the SSH and OpenVPN ports allowed into the VPN box:
    22, 39055, 39066, 39077, 39094
***BLOCK ALL OTHER INCOMING PORTS***
Optional: restrict port 22 to specific source IP's.
Assume we are logged-in with username="ubuntu" and we have full sudo access.

Step 1:
    run "screen" in case of connection issues

Step 2:
    Download from the github repos "test":
        mkdir /home/ubuntu/repos
        cd /home/ubuntu/repos
        git clone https://github.com/burbella/test.git
        cd /home/ubuntu/repos/test
        git checkout tags/24

Step 3:
    Install the YAML Config File:
        sudo cp /home/ubuntu/repos/test/config/zzz.conf /etc
    Edit the YAML Config File:
        sudo nano /etc/zzz.conf
    VPNusers: 'zzz-user1,zzz-user2,zzz-user3'
        Customize as needed - command-separated usernames
        The installer will use this to make OpenVPN connection files for each user.
    IPv4/VPNserver:
        can be set to an IP address or domain or subdomain
        defaults to auto-detecting the external IP
    Domain:
        keep the TLD as .zzz
        Optional:
            customize this in the Config file
            Use the new domain in all URL's below.
    Optional: To setup one PC/laptop/phone to connect to two VPN servers, you must customize the "CA" and "Domain" settings each server.
        CA:
            Default: 'Zzz CA' --> change to 'Zzz CA something'
        Domain: 'services.zzz.zzz' --> change to 'services.something.zzz'
        Use the new domain in all URL's below.
        Only one VPN server can be connected at a time.

Step 4:
    a) Run the installer as root: (on a terminal running the "screen" app)
            sudo /home/ubuntu/repos/test/install.sh
       Watch the installer progress in a second terminal: (OPTIONAL)
            sudo tail -F /var/log/zzz/install/install.log
    b) OS updates will be done, then it will auto-reboot
    c) After reboot, re-connect to SSH and start the "screen" app again:
            screen
       Run the installer again to finish setup:
            sudo /home/ubuntu/repos/test/install.sh
       It will check the /etc/zzz.conf file and ask you to confirm if it is correct or not
       If config errors are reported:
            fix the config file
            run the installer again
       If some config entry is not what you wanted:
            answer "n" to the confirmation question
            fix the config file
            run the installer again

Step 5:
    REBOOT REQUIRED:
        when "ZZZEVPN INSTALLER DONE" is printed in the terminal, take note of the instructions printed on the terminal
        press "y" to reboot
        the system will be ready to use after this reboot
    Some OS updates and zzz-installer system file changes do not all take effect until after reboot.

Step 8: (optional)
    MaxMind account setup
    Looking up the country for each IP in logs requires a database from maxmind.com
    maxmind.com requires you to create an account to download the database
    Without this, all countries will show as unknown in the log view pages
    1) Setup a maxmind account:
        https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup
    2) Generate a license key in the NEW format on maxmind.com
        Save the license key and account ID
    3) Install the license key and account ID in the Zzz server by editing the GeoIP config file:
        sudo nano /etc/GeoIP.conf
    4) Run geoipupdate
        sudo /usr/bin/geoipupdate
    5) Verify if the maxmind DB date updated:
        https://services.zzz.zzz/z/installed_software
    6) Edit /etc/zzz.conf:
            sudo nano /etc/zzz.conf
        Change this value to True:
            EnableMaxMind: 'True'
    7) Run the IP-country update:
        sudo /opt/zzz/python/bin/update-ip-log.py --country
    8) Restart apache and the zzz daemon:
        https://services.zzz.zzz/z/sys/restart/apache
        https://services.zzz.zzz/z/sys/restart/zzz
